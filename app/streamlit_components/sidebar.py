        ## **Usage**
        **Always let processes to finish before interacting with other components.**
        
        Enter a full URL in format https://www.example.com.
        
        Some website might have **anti-bot measurements**, which **block bots** from visiting their webpages. Therefore the program **won't** be able to extract HTML documents from protected websites.
        
        If there's a connection error during extraction or it mentions that the **content might be blocked**, use a different URL.
        
        Similarly, since API calls are made to generate SEO keywords, they can often result in errors from server side.
        If an error occurs, you can check this official site for more information [Gemini API error codes](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/troubleshooting). 
        
        Currently, there's an error with vietnamese language not being output correctly. There may be mistakes if you choose to generate keywords in vietnamese.

        [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

        ---

        ### 📄 **Extracting HTML Documents**
        Make sure to enter your Gemini API key before extracting. It is used free of cost during extraction to calculate token length of HTML documents. 

        When you click on **"Extract HTML documents"**, the app will extract internal links from the provided URL.  

        It will then attempt to extract **desired number of HTML documents** from the **most frequently mentioned** internal links, preferably selecting those with **shorter URL paths** to obtain varied informations.

        When the model token limit is exceeded, the app will reduce the number of HTML documents used for keyword generation. 

        ⚠️ **Reminder:** Extraction takes longer with higher number of HTML documents needed to extract. (up to 1 minute)
            Extractions are affected by the website's response speed as well. Depending on their speed, the extraction can take longer than 1 minute. 

        ---

        ### 🧠 **Generating Keywords**
        After a successful HTML extraction, the option to **generate keywords** will become available.  

        You can customize your keyword generation with the following parameters:
        - **Temperature** (controls creativity)
        - **Presence penalty** (controls variety)
        - **Language** of the generated keywords
        - **Number of keywords** to generate

        The app uses the **extracted HTML documents** as context in the prompt to generate **SEO optimized keywords**.  

        > ⚠️ **Reminder:** Generating keywords consumes tokens and may incur costs, depending on what API key is used.
        > This can lead to **large token usage**, depending on the amount of HTML documents selected and their size.
        > BUG: Currently, there's an error with vietnamese language not being output correctly. There may be mistakes if you choose to generate keywords in vietnamese.
